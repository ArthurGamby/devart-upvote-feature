## 💡 Widget Integration Example

This is what developers would add to their website:

```html
<!-- Add VoteHub widget -->
<script src="https://votehub.com/widget.js"></script>
<script>
  VoteHub.init({
    projectId: 'your-project-id',
    position: 'bottom-right', // or 'bottom-left'
    theme: 'dark' // or 'light'
  });
</script>
```

The widget then:
1. Shows a floating button in the corner
2. Opens a slide-in panel when clicked
3. Allows users to vote and submit features
4. Syncs all data with your dashboard
